# TODO list 
- make move test to check inode operation rename
- Fix the two root directories
- update directory using btree
- Update using clusters for at least files
- Check how we can checksums for data integrity and shorter names
- Check how we can decrease the length using the checksums/hash
- Check for possibility to use btree for everything instead of using bitmap. See: Btrfs paper: https://dominoweb.draco.res.ibm.com/reports/rj10501.pdf
- Use iozone, fxmark, iostat to check the scalability and performance of the different filesystems. More reliable than doing it manually. Moreover, we won't reinvent the wheel. See paper, for more information.
- Check how the filesystem can be defragmented also including garbage collection
- check how we can use cache to reduce the I/O costs. LRU which is around 10% of the total memory
- Check how the filesystem can truncate/shrink during write_begin/end
- Check how a snapshot can be made using reflink
- Read more about log-structured filesystems: including lectures of storage systems
- Report about all of this in the paper
- free space management using buddy slab allocator/ pre-allocation
- Check what the durability/performance trade-off is for all these features
- Create tests in c for the fsck. If necessary also let this fsck repair the filesystem in case of any wrongdoings
- Improve mkfs in c, including flags other options
